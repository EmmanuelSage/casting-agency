# Casting Agency

[Hosted on Heroku at : https://casting-agency-nano.herokuapp.com](https://casting-agency-nano.herokuapp.com)

The motivation for this project is to create my capstone project for Udacity's Fullstack Nanodegree program.
It models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies.
The assumption is that I am an Executive Producer within the company and wants to create a system to simplify and streamline my process process.
